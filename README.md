## Time-Series Modeling for Gurugram Air Quality

This project explores time-series modeling techniques to analyze trends and potentially forecast air quality in Gurugram, India. Time-series data consists of measurements recorded at consistent intervals over time, making it ideal for understanding how air quality changes throughout the year.

**Analyzing Air Quality Trends:**

By applying time-series modeling to the Gurugram Air Quality Index data, we can:

* Identify patterns and trends in air quality metrics.
* Uncover potential seasonal variations in air pollution.
* Explore correlations between air quality and weather conditions.

**Machine Learning for Air Quality Forecasting:**

Time-series models can be used to forecast future air quality levels. This project may investigate the implementation of various models, including:

* **Moving Averages:** Averages over a defined window to smooth short-term fluctuations.
* **ARIMA (Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average):** A statistical model that leverages past values and errors to predict future air quality.
* **Exponential Smoothing:** Assigns weights to past observations, placing more emphasis on recent data.
* **LSTMs (Long Short-Term Memory):** A powerful machine learning approach for complex time-series data, potentially enabling more accurate air quality predictions.

This project aims to leverage these models to analyze historical air quality data and potentially develop forecasts for future air quality in Gurugram.
